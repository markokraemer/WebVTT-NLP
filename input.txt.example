Kindly respond in the chat
whether you agree with the recording.

9aad3f5c-a5e7-40b2-bd76-4eba2aa0d70a-2
00:00:10.648 --> 00:00:14.527
Please do not use thumbs up,
respond in writing.

9aad3f5c-a5e7-40b2-bd76-4eba2aa0d70a-3
00:00:14.527 --> 00:00:16.160
Thank you.

Please include your name in the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.911
A thumbs up is not sufficient,
please respond in writing.

c44307cf-9817-416e-9b76-7662a520ccad-1
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:26.998
Please confirm with a yes or
okay, or similar.

c44307cf-9817-416e-9b76-7662a520ccad-2
00:00:26.998 --> 00:00:30.399
We will start recording now,
this will be included at the beginning.

c44307cf-9817-416e-9b76-7662a520ccad-3
00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:31.760
Thank you.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.112
Preparation for the final
accounting is a topic that

89c5fdc2-794b-488f-a07f-b753ab03393f-1
00:00:38.112 --> 00:00:40.677
concerns us all and

89c5fdc2-794b-488f-a07f-b753ab03393f-2
00:00:40.677 --> 00:00:43.984
interestingly, it always comes
sooner than we expect.

89c5fdc2-794b-488f-a07f-b753ab03393f-3
00:00:43.984 --> 00:00:47.519
I always say that preparation
for the final accounting begins

89c5fdc2-794b-488f-a07f-b753ab03393f-4
00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.224
with the project, as we monitor
all costs throughout.

89c5fdc2-794b-488f-a07f-b753ab03393f-5
00:00:51.224 --> 00:00:53.790
We try to keep these costs
minimal, especially

55f40a12-1efd-4bef-be90-8165622df505-0
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.118
commitments. We also monitor
receivables and

55f40a12-1efd-4bef-be90-8165622df505-1
00:00:58.118 --> 00:01:00.008
liabilities.

113c8a66-c750-45ac-83b3-d28f666170de-0
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.251
Eventually, the best time ends,
and the project must be

113c8a66-c750-45ac-83b3-d28f666170de-1
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:07.520
brought to final accounting.

9e498f05-1f20-4040-8114-51b5bf5e7f86-0
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.998
What are the key financial
points? We ensure that all

9e498f05-1f20-4040-8114-51b5bf5e7f86-1
00:01:11.998 --> 00:01:15.352
commitments are resolved, meaning
all contractual obligations.

9e498f05-1f20-4040-8114-51b5bf5e7f86-2
00:01:15.352 --> 00:01:18.760
We ensure all receivables are
collected, typically

9e498f05-1f20-4040-8114-51b5bf5e7f86-3
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.789
prepayments, and that all

9e498f05-1f20-4040-8114-51b5bf5e7f86-4
00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:23.520
liabilities are settled.

7136a155-82e9-4da9-9770-c6f11ba05694-0
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.398
Liabilities are typically
unpaid debts for services

7136a155-82e9-4da9-9770-c6f11ba05694-1
00:01:28.398 --> 00:01:31.403
received.

b1729478-b09f-4a66-b5f7-730d565eec7a-0
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.155
This process can be somewhat
challenging.

19cc5a75-196a-4611-9a26-debaf4721440-0
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.120
Annika, you can turn off your
camera now.

8fe4a3d7-7990-408b-a274-851ef4c994eb-0
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.390
We will start shortly.

d1c28308-73ef-49d0-8b3e-35b8af3eecfc-0
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.520
That's all from me for now.

fedb18f7-2e8e-4f7c-93ac-4dd484d196dd-0
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.710
Let's get started.

9bba03c7-89fc-464f-bbb0-a9063eeffef5-0
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.830
Move that over, so we have the
SAP ready.

a14f6148-96c3-4364-b3a4-ad06f3e20470-0
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.152
As mentioned earlier, we will
resolve all

a14f6148-96c3-4364-b3a4-ad06f3e20470-1
00:02:07.152 --> 00:02:10.552
receivables, liabilities, and
commitments.

a14f6148-96c3-4364-b3a4-ad06f3e20470-2
00:02:10.552 --> 00:02:14.456
Please keep your cameras off to
avoid being recorded. Thank you.

a18552db-117b-45d7-a98f-2d14f09e8cfa-0
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.780
We need to resolve all these
issues. We also have the

a18552db-117b-45d7-a98f-2d14f09e8cfa-1
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.880
challenge of coordinating with
external entities,

a18552db-117b-45d7-a98f-2d14f09e8cfa-2
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.033
especially if we have multiple
regional offices.

a18552db-117b-45d7-a98f-2d14f09e8cfa-3
00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:33.347
We need to ensure everything is
ready for final accounting.

ad39477d-8be0-4bc7-933c-14c0398ffd1c-0
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.615
Additionally, the size of the
project can impact the tasks

ad39477d-8be0-4bc7-933c-14c0398ffd1c-1
00:02:45.615 --> 00:02:47.060
required for final accounting.

ab004252-ff82-4b4d-a9d4-376004712db7-0
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.235
Tasks to be completed include
reviewing

ab004252-ff82-4b4d-a9d4-376004712db7-1
00:02:51.235 --> 00:02:54.804
project files from A to Z, ensuring
everything is

ab004252-ff82-4b4d-a9d4-376004712db7-2
00:02:54.804 --> 00:02:58.828
documented, including contracts,
financial reports, and

ab004252-ff82-4b4d-a9d4-376004712db7-3
00:02:58.828 --> 00:03:02.073
other relevant documents.

ab004252-ff82-4b4d-a9d4-376004712db7-4
00:03:02.073 --> 00:03:06.227
We need to ensure everything is
complete and finalized.

ab004252-ff82-4b4d-a9d4-376004712db7-5
00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:09.862
This includes reviewing
contracts and ensuring

ab004252-ff82-4b4d-a9d4-376004712db7-6
00:03:09.862 --> 00:03:13.496
all purchased reports are
documented.

ab004252-ff82-4b4d-a9d4-376004712db7-7
00:03:13.496 --> 00:03:17.260
Everything must be complete and
documented.

d471f348-2476-4852-93af-5652f5c35eb4-0
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.749
We often have audits from
various agencies,

d471f348-2476-4852-93af-5652f5c35eb4-1
00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:25.724
and it has been noted that while
we have contract files,

d471f348-2476-4852-93af-5652f5c35eb4-2
00:03:25.724 --> 00:03:29.815
we sometimes lack the final
reports.

d471f348-2476-4852-93af-5652f5c35eb4-3
00:03:29.815 --> 00:03:33.659
These reports, such as progress
and final reports,

d471f348-2476-4852-93af-5652f5c35eb4-4
00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.068
should be documented to show the
results.

d471f348-2476-4852-93af-5652f5c35eb4-5
00:03:37.068 --> 00:03:39.981
This ensures everything is
properly recorded.

16a17ab9-b62f-4353-81a9-7cc8a7f20b54-0
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.759
Review all digital and paper
project files.

16a17ab9-b62f-4353-81a9-7cc8a7f20b54-1
00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:57.879
Many have lost track of paper
files during the pandemic.

16a17ab9-b62f-4353-81a9-7cc8a7f20b54-2
00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.323
I must admit, I have as well.

16a17ab9-b62f-4353-81a9-7cc8a7f20b54-3
00:04:01.323 --> 00:04:03.350
We need to organize these files.

876187fc-7d23-42b6-80ff-b63690a16ca8-0
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.380
These paper files need to be
organized and eventually archived.

876187fc-7d23-42b6-80ff-b63690a16ca8-1
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.750
Thank you.

d64d5ff6-f3d9-4d11-978d-3f37f670e463-0
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.010
There are also the P and R rules,
section 262. Hello Heidi.

ddbfd0c4-c450-4e84-ac79-f0b57f97c7e3-0
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.185
Please turn off your cameras as
we are recording,

ddbfd0c4-c450-4e84-ac79-f0b57f97c7e3-1
00:04:25.185 --> 00:04:26.840
otherwise you will be in the
video.
